> Passera turns entered text into a strong password up to 64 characters long.

A simple tool that allows users to have strong unique passwords for each website, without the need to store them either locally or with an online service. It is available as a [command-line tool for Linux/Mac/Windows and an Android app](https://github.com/mwgg/passera).

## Passera as Firefox/Chrome-like Web-extension (Add-on)

This is a fork of the [original Passera Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passera/), ported like web-extension —currently in an early stage of development, a.k.a. _beta release_—. **This project is not intended to improve the encryption algorithm or security considerations.** The real objective of the project is to facilitate the use of the _Passera_ as a user tool.
